# Getting started building component libraries with the AngularÂ CLI

One of the things that's always had a higher barrier of entry in the Angular ecosystem is creating libraries of components that other Angular apps can use. The Angular team published guidance with things like the [Angular Package Format](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CZC2rcpxffTDfRDs6p1cfbmKNLA6x5O-NtkJglDaBVs/edit) and from that the community has created some fantastic tools, like [generator-angular2-library](https://github.com/jvandemo/generator-angular2-library), that make it easier. However, there was never a tool that generated opinionated implementations of the Angular Package Format the same way that developers who used the Angular CLI in their normal project workflows were used to.

With the recent release of version 6 for the Angular CLI, we now have access to tools that can help us build libraries while still taking advantage of other powerful aspects of the CLI, such as schematics, without leaving the workflows we are used to! Let's talk about how you can use the CLI to get started building your own component libraries.

We'll cover:

* [Generating a library with the Angular CLI](#generating-a-library-project-with-the-angular-cli)
* Using schematics to build components for our library
* Creating a sample app that uses our library
* Publishing the library and how to use it/test it locally in other apps.

## Generating a library project with the Angular CLI

First thing's first. Let's setup our project. If you don't have the latest version of the CLI let's grab it from npm.

```bash
$ npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
```

Now let's create a new project with the CLI. Nothing new here.

```bash
$ ng new my-app
```

If you're used to working with the Angular CLI you might notice a couple changes to the project structure you know and love. The most noticable of which is that the old `angular-cli.json` is gone and now replace with a new `angular.json` file. This file is the key to one of the biggest new features in version 6. Now the Angular CLI can create and work with workspaces that contain one or more multiple Angular apps. This `angular.json` file gives you control over the configuration of each of those projects. This is ultimately what makes building of libraries within the CLI possible because we need handle the building of libraries differently than we normally would for normal Angular apps.

Ok - so now we know a bit more about how libraries within CLI pojects work; let's generate the library structure in our project. We do this with the `generate` command just like we would to create a component, service, module, etc...

```bash
$ ng generate library my-new-lib
```

This creates a new `/projects` directory with a new folder for your library. We some example files, and some newer files.

The files to really take note of here are `/src/public_api.ts`, `ng-package.json`, and `ng-package.prod.json`. These files control the configuration for [ng-packagr](https://github.com/dherges/ng-packagr) - the library that powers the packaging of your library. I encourage you to check out the project and familiarize yourself with how it works, but here is a quick and dirty overview:

* `public_api.ts` is the new entry point for your library. If you have any files that you want accessable to consumers of your library (modules, components, etc...) you need to export them here in addition to exporting them from whatever modules are in your library.

```typescript
/* src/public_api.ts */

export * from './lib/my-new-library.service';
export * from './lib/my-new-library.component';
export * from './lib/my-new-library.module';
```

* `ng-package.json` and `ng-package.prod.json` control the configuration for the packaging process that ng-packagr performs. You can use them to change things like the destination build directory or defining a different entry point for your app. `ng-package.json` is used during your `ng build` command and `ng-package.prod.json` is used when you run `ng build --prod`. The only difference between these two files right now is that `ng-package.json` contains a `deleteDestPath` flag that will delete your destination directory before running a build. This will be helpful during development when you are constantly making changes.

> Protip: if your library needs to do something like bundle an overall Sass file, you will need to include something like [scss-bundle](https://github.com/SimplrJS/scss-bundle) in your workflow.
